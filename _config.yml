# Welcome to Jekyll!

# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

#About Me 
about_me:  |
  Hello! I'm Azucena, but you can call me Susy. I am currently a graduate student in M.S. Applied Computer Science with experience in supervised machine learning. 
  My work includes published research on Non-Invasive Pre-Diabetes, Type 1, and Type 2 Diabetes Screening, 
  as well as Early Detection of At-Risk Students Using Machine Learning. 
  I have developed proficiency in Python and applied it to create predictive models with strong results.
  I am particularly interested in expanding my skill set by learning both front-end and back-end web development. 
  My goal is to build a deeper understanding of web technologies and gain hands-on experience in full-stack development, 
  combining my technical background with new web design and development skills.
