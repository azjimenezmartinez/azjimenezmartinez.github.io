        Hello! My name is Azucena, but you can call me Susy! I am currently a graduate student in M.S. Applied Computer Science with experience in supervised machine learning. 
        My work includes published research on Non-Invasive Pre-Diabetes, Type 1, and Type 2 Diabetes Screening, 
        as well as Early Detection of At-Risk Students Using Machine Learning. 
        I have developed proficiency in Python and applied it to create predictive models with strong results.
    </p>
    <p> 
        I am particularly interested in expanding my skill set by learning both front-end and back-end web development. 
        My goal is to build a deeper understanding of web technologies and gain hands-on experience in full-stack development, 
        combining my technical background with new web design and development skills. 
    </p>
